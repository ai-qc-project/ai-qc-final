1- open terminal 
2- git clone https://github.com/ai-qc-project/ai-qc-final.git
3- cd ai-qc-final 
4- pip install -r requirements.txt 


Resnet Classification Training:

1- place images in the dataset folder (Images with no defect in "PASSED" and defected images in "FAILED")
2- python3 aug.py (optional for images augmentation) 
3- python3 resnset_train.py

FASTERCNN Defects Detection Training:
1- place your augmented dataset using LabelImg in the project directory
2- open you dataset config file and set the training and validation images location
3- python3 faster_cnn_train.py

Video Inferencing:
1-run video_inference.py
2- find results in (video_result) directory

API Inferencing:
1- run api.py
2- find results in (api_result) directory



Notes:
1- when augmenting images add the new images to raw/FAIL & PASS directories and after running the code you will find the new images located in the Dataset/ FAIL & PASS directories
2- when training a new model you wil find the new model as a .pt file with the name " mymodel.pt "
